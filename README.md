# Online shopping store

## Second project for Ada ITW 

This is the 2nd challenge that Ada Institute prepared for us: an online shopping store, this time implementing JavaScript programming language. I couldn't be more grateful for these last weeks, as I feel like my technical skills were taken to a whole different level, and it's certainly the most rewarding experience that 2020 isolation circumstances indulged me with to keep my spirit going. You might want to take a look at the online store model we were based on, in terms of structure, JS code and so forth: [https://frontend-proyecto-tienda.adaitw.org/].
A detail worth mentioning is that for this project, we hadn't learnt arrays yet so whatever you may obvserve from JS code when a certain list of items had to be looped through, it won't be under array methods but using the most primarily way of working with lists of items. 

 ## Technologies used

 Modest HTML, twice as large CSS and a pretty decent amount of Javascript. Feel free to test my site's responsiveness as wide and as stretched as you'd like to. 

### Where to check on my online shopping store

Here's my cheerful online shopping store which design patterns I came up with at a time when a website's appearance wasn't truly a matter of popular procedures to me. For better or for worse, I no longer subscribe to this kind of choices. Hopefuly you'll mostly focus on it's scripting bearing in mind what's been warned above.
